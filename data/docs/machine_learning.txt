Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data.
Common types of machine learning are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Python is widely used for machine learning with libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
Applications include image recognition, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
